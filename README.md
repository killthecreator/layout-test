In first footer section background was not provided as a single image, but as set of svg ellipses, so it might be slightly off comparing to figma original layout.

Seems like the design of the second footer section is not symmetric (columns are all with different space between them) or i didn't get the pattern, so it doesn't match the original layout from figma in my case.
